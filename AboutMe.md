I am a computer science major and am in my senior year at New paltz. I have taken most of the courses in the computer science program. A list of the computer science courses I have taken are Computer Science I: Foundations, Computer Science II: Data Structures , Computer Science III, Assembly Language &amp; Computer Architecture , Operating Systems I , Oriented Programming, Software Engineering, Discrete &amp; Continuous Computer Algorithms, Language Processing and Introduction to Data Science. The one that pertains most to this class was Software Engineering where I collaborated with a group of my peers to create an Electronic Health Record website using html, css, php with a database using MySQL.

In this course I hope to learn some more practical skills with web development as most of the prior courses focused on programming practices and theory. The skills I will gain from this I will be able to use in my personal projects as well as in my future career. While I do have experience with web programming there are a lot of frameworks I have not used before so I&#39;m hoping to learn and sharpen my skills. I have not yet fully decided what specialization I want to go into so I can learn more about web development and more in depth knowledge. Im looking forward to learning more about what web development is capable of through this course.
